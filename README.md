Playing a game without knowing the rules.

X. "SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?" - W.O.P.R.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

With the risk of disappointing a few: today there will be no Global Thermonuclear War.

- In this tenth video I am showing how to teach an AI how to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe WITHOUT actually teaching it the RULES how to win the game. It is based on the idea of challenge-response-learning which I showed in my fourth video (the diagram at 6:54 there may be useful). I play with it, it loses; but it observes how I won, and wins the next game. "Winning" is just a recognised state, it is not explicitly aimed for. I try keep it very, very simple.

The idea is this: for action in your world, you need no specific "goals". "Imitation" fully suffices - the system then learns by evolution of its knowledge for imitation. You just have to find out the "right" pattern responses in order to react "correctly"/"intelligently" (for this, you can use ANYTHING you like, neural nets, Bayesian, statistical... I prefer currently my fragmentation sets). - Practically the same approach should indeed work with ANY game, not just Tic-Tac-Toe. (And later on: DO ANYTHING, not only play games, also chat or move through space as a robot or other artificial intelligence endeavours.)

(Now, if you connect this with the fragmentation set approach of the last video [which focused on the recognition of patterns], it is easy to realize that a system is already conceivable which combines "recognition" with "imitation". - In the next (eleventh) video, I shall show how to add "situational awareness" or "context" - which is nothing else than a "bigger pattern". In the twelveth video, I shall show how to link this all together into making ... a chatbot, my favourite demonstration device for AGI [and I propose to pronounce this acronym as "eggy"].)
